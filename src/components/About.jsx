            Hi, I’m Predrag – a Frontend Developer with Big Goals
          </h3>
          <p className="text-body">
            Volunteering for a year with Chingu.io was a game-changer for me. It
            helped me refine my work ethic and gain invaluable real-world
            experience building complex applications in an Agile environment
            using Scrum practices.
            <br />
            <br />
            Work consistency, clean and scalable code, and well-written
            documentation are the cornerstones of my work. I think that great
            code doesn’t just work, it should be easy to read, maintain, and
            build upon by other members. I’ve been sharing my coding journey on
            GitHub and YouTube, documenting lessons learned.
            <br />
            <br />
            My long-term goal is to deepen my understanding of backend
            technologies, including Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I’m excited
            to expand my skill set beyond front-end development, enabling me to
            build seamless full-stack applications and tackle more complex
            challenges.
