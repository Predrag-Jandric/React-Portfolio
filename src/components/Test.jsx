      We developed an appointment scheduling management application as a team at
      Chingu, a global collaboration platform. Predrag consistently took the
      initiative in a project, from selecting tools to setting up the
      application. He fostered teamwork by addressing challenges openly and
      often used videos to explain bugs and resolve them collaboratively. I am
      impressed by his demonstration and communication skills, as well as his
      ability to share his knowledge by explaining technologies clearly and
      effectively. I am grateful for the opportunity to work together as a team,
      and I appreciate his dedication and contributions in helping us complete
      the project.
