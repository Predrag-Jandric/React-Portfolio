    about: `Split Smart is an application that aims to make splitting expenses among friends, family, or colleagues easy. Whether planning a trip, organizing a group dinner, or managing shared expenses, Split Smart helps you keep track of who owes what and ensures that everyone pays their equal or unequal share. Your data is automatically saved in your browser locally so that you can always come back to where you left off.\n\nBuilding Split Smart taught me valuable lessons about listening to feedback and improving the app with in-depth testing. I also learned the importance of clear documentation for future development and maintenance. One of the major technical challenges was implementing the logic for accurate contribution changes for each member and ensuring that the app was user-friendly and intuitive.\n\nOur team consisted of one Product Owner, two Developers, one UX/UI Designer, and one Scrum Master. We followed Agile methodologies, with regular sprints, iterations, and backlog management. Design and implementation decisions were made collaboratively, ensuring a simple and efficient approach.\n\nMy role included implementing complex logic, managing state with Redux, turning designs into a fully responsive user interface, fixing bugs and optimizing. I also worked on integrating animations and charts, writing documentation, testing and implementing the dark mode.`,

Users can browse through products, filter them by categories, search for specific items, and add things to their shopping cart. Logged in users can also view their past orders. The app is fully responsive, works across all devices, and includes features like pagination and login/logout.\n\nWorking on this project helped me get more comfortable with things like syncing filters and search queries, handling paginated product data, and managing a lot of global state using Redux. I also got to use TypeScript, which made the development easier and helped catch bugs early. Figuring out how to keep the cart and user sessions working well across the app and how to connect and sync frontend with the backend were the biggest challenges which took team collaboration and a lot of pair programming sessions.\n\nWe followed an Agile process with sprints, planning sessions, and team check ins. In the beginning, we had separate frontend and backend teams, but as technical debt started to build up, we realized we needed to work as one team to succeed and solve all the problems. There was a lot of pair programming, testing, and helping each other out along the way.\n\nMy main focus was on the frontend, building out the core logic, implementing API calls, styling the UI with Tailwind, and making sure everything worked well across different devices. I worked on the cart, search and filter functionality, order history, and page layouts. I also did a lot of pair programming with the team.
