    about: `Split Smart is an application that aims to make splitting expenses among friends, family, or colleagues easy. Whether planning a trip, organizing a group dinner, or managing shared expenses, Split Smart helps you keep track of who owes what and ensures that everyone pays their equal or unequal share. Your data is automatically saved in your browser locally so that you can always come back to where you left off.\n\nBuilding Split Smart taught me valuable lessons about listening to feedback and improving the app with in-depth testing. I also learned the importance of clear documentation for future development and maintenance. One of the major technical challenges was implementing the logic for accurate contribution changes for each member and ensuring that the app was user-friendly and intuitive.\n\nOur team consisted of 1 Product Owner, 2 Developers, 1 UX/UI Designer, and 1 Scrum Master. We followed Agile methodologies, with regular sprints, iterations, and backlog management. Design and implementation decisions were made collaboratively, ensuring a simple and efficient approach.\n\nMy role included implementing complex logic, managing state with Redux, turning designs into a fully responsive user interface, fixing bugs and optimizing. I also worked on integrating animations and charts, writing documentation, testing and implementing the dark mode.`,
    howItWorksList: `Users can:\n1. Create groups for different events or activities.\n2. Add members to the groups and assign expenses.\n3. Track total budget, expenses, and remaining budget.\n4. Customize contributions for each member.\n5. Edit group details, such as name, description, and image.\n6. Search for groups using the search bar.\n7. Toggle between light and dark modes for a comfortable viewing experience.`,
    howItWorksText: `We used React as the main framework for building the user interface and logic. Redux Toolkit for global state management. React Router for page switching. Tailwind CSS for styling. Framer Motion for animations. Recharts for pie chart visualization. React Icons and React Toastify for icons and notifications.`
