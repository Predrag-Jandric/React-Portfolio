- make sure all the animations trigger only when the element in fully or partially in view, with viewport={{ once: true, amount: "all" }} or amount: 0.5 for fine tuning
- check paddings on X axis when resizing on most of the sections. are they equal for all sections on small screen
- test navbar, especially mobile navbar version for all bug possibilities
- make sure all text is not pure black but dark gray
- double check do shadows appear on all sides especially on the bottom, on all container classes
